    <p>Once upon a time, not so long ago</p>
    <p>
        Tommy used to work on the docks, union's been on strike
        He's down on his luck, it's tough, so tough
        Gina works the diner all day, working for her man
        She brings home her pay, for love, mmm, for love
    </p>
    <p>
        She says, "We've gotta hold on to what we've got
        It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
        We've got each other and that's a lot for love
        We'll give it a shot"
    </p>
    <p>
        Whoa, we're half way there
        Whoa oh, livin' on a prayer
        Take my hand, we'll make it, I swear
        Whoa oh, livin' on a prayer  
    </p> 
    <p>
        Tommy's got his six string in hock, now he's holding in
        When he used to make it talk so tough, ooh, it's tough
        Gina dreams of running away
        When she cries in the night, Tommy whispers
        "Baby, it's okay, someday"
    </p>
    <p>
        We've gotta hold on to what we've got
        It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
        We've got each other and that's a lot for love
        We'll give it a shot
    </p>
    <p>
        Whoa, we're half way there
        Whoa oh, livin' on a prayer
        Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
        Whoa oh, livin' on a prayer
        Livin' on a prayer 
    </p>    
    <p>
        Oh, we've gotta hold on, ready or not
        You live for the fight when that's all that you've got 
    </p>  
    <p>
        Whoa, we're half way there
        Whoa oh, livin' on a prayer
        Take my hand and we'll make it, I swear
        Whoa oh, livin' on a prayer
    </p> 
    <p>
        Whoa, we're half way there
        Whoa oh, livin' on a prayer
        Take my hand and we'll make it, I swear
        Whoa oh, livin' on a prayer
    </p>
    <p>
        Whoa, we're half way there
        Whoa oh, livin' on a prayer
        Take my hand and we'll make it, I swear
        Whoa oh
